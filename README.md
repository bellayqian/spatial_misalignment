# Spatial Misalignment Analysis with ABRM

This repository contains code and data for analyzing spatially misaligned data using Atom-Based Regression Models (ABRM) and comparing them with traditional dasymetric mapping approaches.

## Interactive Dashboard

An interactive dashboard visualizing the atom-based regression models is available at:
[https://bellayqian.shinyapps.io/abrm-dashboard/](https://bellayqian.shinyapps.io/abrm-dashboard/)

## Repository Structure

- **poisson_analysis**: R scripts for statistical analysis comparing ABRM with dasymetric mapping

- **dashboard**: Interactive Shiny dashboard for visualizing counties, congressional districts, and atoms

- **data_preprocessing**: Scripts for preparing and preprocessing data

The dashboard allows you to explore:
- County boundaries
- Congressional district boundaries
- Atom counts and distributions
- Data tables for counties and atoms
